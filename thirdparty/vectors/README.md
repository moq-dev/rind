# Vector files

Copies of the vector files in [aws-lc] and [BoringSSL] that cover an
algorithm rind offers. `admin/sync-vectors` fetches them, unmodified, from the
revisions it pins, and lists every file. Both repositories are hundreds of
megabytes, so rind keeps these copies rather than submodules.

The aws-lc and BoringSSL directories each hold their upstream's `LICENSE`.
To update, bump a revision in `admin/sync-vectors` and rerun it.

The tests read them through `rind/src/test/file_test.rs`, which parses the
FileTest format both projects share.

`rfc9180/test-vectors.json` holds [RFC 9180]'s HPKE vectors, from the
CFRG draft's repository at the revision `admin/sync-vectors` pins: the base
mode's, one per line, for the KEMs rind offers. The revision in
[hpkewg/hpke] repeats them unchanged. They are IETF contributions, under
[BCP 78].

`rfc9380/` holds [RFC 9380]'s hash-to-curve vectors, its Appendix J and K,
from the CFRG draft's `poc/vectors` at the revision `admin/sync-vectors`
pins: the `expand_message_xmd` files and the P-256, P-384, and P-521
`_RO_` suites, named without the colons Windows cannot check out. They are
IETF contributions too.

`rfc9909/` holds [RFC 9909]'s appendix C examples, an SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s
public key, private key, and self-signed certificate, decoded from the RFC's
PEM to DER by hand, since no repository publishes them. They too are IETF
contributions, under [BCP 78].

`rfc9474/test-vectors.json` holds [RFC 9474]'s four RSABSSA vectors, from
[blind-rsa-signatures] at the revision `admin/sync-vectors` pins, as the
CFRG draft's repository holds stale ones. They are IETF contributions, under
[BCP 78].

`rfc9497/allVectors.json` holds [RFC 9497]'s OPRF vectors, its Appendix A,
from the CFRG draft's `poc/vectors` at the revision `admin/sync-vectors`
pins: the OPRF and VOPRF modes of the ristretto255, P-256, P-384, and P-521
suites, without decaf448 and the POPRF mode, which rind does not offer.
They are IETF contributions, under [BCP 78].
