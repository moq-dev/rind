# Vector files

Copies of the vector files rind's tests read from [aws-lc], [BoringSSL],
[Wycheproof], NIST's [CAVP] through the [ctz/cavp] mirror, and [CCTV].
`admin/sync-vectors` fetches them, unmodified, from the revisions it pins,
and lists every file. The tests read a small part of each repository, so
rind keeps these copies rather than submodules, and a plain clone runs every
test. Each test opens its files by name and fails on a missing one.

Each upstream's directory keeps its upstream's paths, a `REVISION` file
naming the commit it was copied from, and its license: aws-lc's, BoringSSL's,
and Wycheproof's `LICENSE` (Apache 2.0 for Wycheproof); CAVP's `README.md`,
which names NIST's sources, whose sample files are U.S. government works;
CCTV's `ed25519/LICENSE` for its Ed25519 vectors, and `ML-KEM/README.md`,
which puts its ML-KEM vectors under CC0 1.0.
To update, bump a revision in `admin/sync-vectors` and rerun it.

The tests read the aws-lc and BoringSSL files through
`rind/src/test/file_test.rs`, which parses the FileTest format both projects
share.

`rfc9180/test-vectors.json` holds [RFC 9180]'s HPKE vectors, from the
CFRG draft's repository at the revision `admin/sync-vectors` pins: the base
mode's, one per line, for the KEMs rind offers. The revision in
[hpkewg/hpke] repeats them unchanged. They are IETF contributions, under
[BCP 78].

`rfc9380/` holds [RFC 9380]'s hash-to-curve vectors, its Appendix J and K,
from the CFRG draft's `poc/vectors` at the revision `admin/sync-vectors`
pins: the `expand_message_xmd` files and the P-256, P-384, and P-521
`_RO_` suites, named without the colons Windows cannot check out. They are
IETF contributions too.

`rfc9474/test-vectors.json` holds [RFC 9474]'s four RSABSSA vectors, from
[blind-rsa-signatures] at the revision `admin/sync-vectors` pins, as the
CFRG draft's repository holds stale ones. They are IETF contributions, under
[BCP 78].

`rfc9497/allVectors.json` holds [RFC 9497]'s OPRF vectors, its Appendix A,
from the CFRG draft's `poc/vectors` at the revision `admin/sync-vectors`
pins: the OPRF and VOPRF modes of the ristretto255, P-256, P-384, and P-521
suites, without decaf448 and the POPRF mode, which rind does not offer.
They are IETF contributions, under [BCP 78].
