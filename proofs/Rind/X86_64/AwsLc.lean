# aws-lc's SHA-512 contract on x86_64

aws-lc-verification's SAW proof that aws-lc's `sha512_block_data_order_avx`
meets `sha512_block_data_order_array_spec`, at the revision rind's README
cites (79730247), restated as an axiom about the opaque Rust wrapper
`compress_avx` around rind's copy of that routine. rind copies it from aws-lc
91c93a8e, whose `sha512-x86_64.pl` is the proven c21d40da's.

The spec's preconditions hold for every call `compress_avx`'s safety contract
allows: `state` and `blocks` are distinct allocations, `blocks` is a whole
number of blocks, at least one, and the token proves AVX. Its precondition on
`OPENSSL_ia32cap_P` names a global that rind's copy of the routine does not
read. rind runs that routine only on Intel's CPUs with AVX but without AVX2.

The restatement, and that rind's naked function is aws-lc's object code with
the wrapper passing the pointers and block count the spec names, are trusted.

For OpenSSL's AVX2 routine, `sha512_block_data_order_avx2`, which rind runs on
CPUs with AVX2, BMI1, BMI2, POPCNT, and SSSE3 but without the SHA512
instructions, rind proves the
routine itself: its HOL Light proof `SHA512_AVX2_SUBROUTINE_CORRECT`, in
`proofs/hol-light/x86_64/sha512_block_data_order_avx2.ml` at rind's commit,
that rind's naked function, as rind's build emits it, computes s2n-bignum's
`sha512_hash_blocks`, from awslabs/s2n-bignum#420 at 7ef7ba7c, restated as an
axiom about the Rust wrapper `compress_avx2` around it. `admin/prove` checks
the HOL Light proof against the object code rind's release build emits, its
instructions, relocations, and the `K512` table they read, on s2n-bignum's
x86 model with the instructions rind adds to it, which `admin/prove cosim`
checks against the CPU. The theorem's hypotheses hold for every call
`compress_avx2`'s safety contract allows: `state` and `blocks` are distinct
allocations, neither overlapping the code, the table, or the 3448 bytes from
the 3440 below the stack pointer, where the routine keeps its frame, through
the return address; `blocks` is a whole number of blocks, at least one, and
it and the 128 bytes after it end below 2^64, as x86_64's user addresses do;
the stack pointer is at least 4096, as page zero is never mapped; the linker
places the table, which `K512`'s type aligns to 64 bytes, within the reach of
the `lea` that addresses it. The restatement, and that the wrapper passes the
pointers and block count the theorem names, are trusted. The OpenSSL routine
for the SHA512 instructions and aws-lc's scalar one have no proof.
