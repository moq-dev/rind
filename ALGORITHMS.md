# Algorithms

Whose code rind runs for each algorithm on each CPU, where that code comes
from and what of it is formally verified, and how the main paths work.
[PLATFORMS.md](PLATFORMS.md) lists the CPU features each architecture
requires.

Each cell names whose code runs on that path: the [sources](#sources) below,
rind's own code, or Graviola's. A ✓ marks code its source formally verifies,
to the extent [Sources](#sources) states, and a ⚡ unverified code chosen
because it measured faster than a verified alternative. An empty cell runs the
same sources as the one to its left. How fast each path runs, against
aws-lc-rs and ring, is in [BENCHMARKS.md's CPU tiers](BENCHMARKS.md#cpu-tiers);
the list under each table gives the reason wherever rind runs slower code by
choice.

x86_64 runs every feature. Each column to its right denies more, as
`bench.yml` describes: no AVX2 denies ADX, AVX2, BMI2, SHA-NI, AVX-512, VAES,
and VPCLMULQDQ (Sandy Bridge); no AVX also AVX (Westmere); no AES-NI also
AES-NI, PCLMULQDQ, and SSE4.1 (Core 2); and SSE2 also SSSE3. Without ADX
alone (Haswell), rind runs the same sources as x86_64, through s2n-bignum's
routines that don't use it, except that Ed25519 verification runs
curve25519-dalek ⚡ (see below).
CPUs with AVX2 but without SHA-NI run [OpenSSL]'s AVX2 SHA-256, and CPUs
with the SHA512 instructions its SHA-384 and SHA-512 for them. Intel CPUs
without AVX2 run [aws-lc]'s AVX SHA-1, SHA-256, and verified ✓ SHA-384 and
SHA-512.

- RSA: x86_64 with ADX multiplies 1024- and 2048-bit moduli by
  [s2n-bignum]'s verified Karatsuba routines, as [#224] decided, rather than
  by [aws-lc]'s `bn_powerx5`, which led by up to 6% on an i7-8700 and trailed
  on Zen 3 and Zen 5. Without AVX2, it gathers each window entry by
  s2n-bignum's verified `bignum_copy_row_from_table` rather than, at widths
  that aren't a multiple of eight words, `bn_mul_mont_gather5`, which fuses
  a faster gather into the product.
- MD5: rind's portable Rust runs on every target, as no CPU has MD5
  instructions. On an i7-8700 it measured level with [aws-lc]'s x86_64
  assembly at 16 KB and 8% faster at 1350 B.
- AES-GCM key setup: a key reaches its cipher through an indirect call, so
  that a binary links only the ciphers it names; the call adds about 3 ns per
  key or 32 B seal.
- P-256 without ADX: verification runs s2n-bignum's verified routines rather
  than aws-lc's `ecp_nistz256`.
- Ed25519 verification without ADX: on CPUs with AVX2, `[S]B - [k]A` runs a
  port of curve25519-dalek's AVX2 backend, variable-time over public inputs,
  rather than s2n-bignum's verified `edwards25519_scalarmuldouble_alt`, a
  constant-time fixed-window loop. Verification fell from 1.31× to 1.09×
  curve25519-dalek's time on an i7-8700 with ADX denied, and from 1.30× to
  1.08× on an OVH VPS whose virtual CPU hides ADX.
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 without AES-NI and on SSE2, which lack SSE4.1: rind runs
  Graviola's scalar Poly1305 there, and aws-lc BoringSSL's SSE2
  `poly1305_vec.c`, which rind doesn't port for CPUs older than Westmere.
- ML-DSA: the FIPS 204 construction, and without AVX2 the arithmetic, run a
  Rust port of [mldsa-native]'s C, outside its CBMC proofs, rather than
  [libcrux]'s ML-DSA, which measured slower at every parameter set, with
  AVX2 and on the portable backend (see [ML-DSA](#ml-dsa)).

aarch64 runs with the crypto extension and the SHA-512 and SHA-3
instructions; no crypto denies them, as a Raspberry Pi 4 lacks them. armv7
runs in 32-bit mode, with NEON and the crypto extension; without them it runs
the code [Symmetric cryptography](#symmetric-cryptography) names. portable is
the backend for every other architecture, for big-endian aarch64 and arm, and
for ARM cores before ARMv7, which CI runs on x86_64 under
`--cfg rind_portable`: armv7's code without NEON and the crypto extension,
with portable Rust in place of the assembly armv7 runs regardless.

- AES header protection on aarch64 pays the same indirect call as AES-GCM
  key setup on x86_64.
- armv7 without crypto: SHA-256 and SHA-1 run aws-lc's NEON routines, or
  its integer ones without NEON. A [native 32-bit comparison](benchmarks/armv7-sha256.md)
  measured them 1.2 to 2.2× faster than Graviola's SHA-256 and rind's SHA-1,
  which in turn ran SHA-256 28–30% faster than HACL*.
- portable: ChaCha20-Poly1305's Poly1305 is Graviola's on 64-bit targets
  and HACL*'s ✓ on 32-bit ones, whose streaming state counts its input in a
  32-bit length that a 64-bit AEAD can overflow. SHA-3's, ML-KEM's, and
  ML-DSA's Keccak-f is rind's, s2n-bignum's Keccak spec in Rust, which
  [`proofs/`](proofs/README.md) proves is FIPS 202's KECCAK-f[1600]; it
  measured as fast as RustCrypto's and libcrux-sha3's, which nothing proves.
  RSA's Montgomery multiplication is rind's own: an interleaved loop below 16
  limbs, then a separate product and reduction, with Karatsuba from 32 limbs.
  Its scratch is on the stack, never on the heap as HACL*'s is.
- portable: RSA and the NIST curves run on 64-bit limbs on 64-bit targets,
  and on wasm32 built with the `wide-arithmetic` target feature (stable from
  Rust 1.101), and on armv7's 32-bit limbs on other 32-bit targets, where a
  64-bit limb's product would be a library call. On 64-bit limbs P-256 and
  P-384 run fiat-crypto's field and scalar arithmetic whole: LLVM keeps its
  carry chains in registers there, and on x86_64 armv7's P-256 loop widened
  to `u128` ran ECDH and verification no faster end to end. The 64-bit columns
  are the ones this table's portable column describes; 32-bit portable
  targets run armv7's sources.
- P-521 on armv7: rind and aws-lc-rs both run [fiat-crypto]'s field
  arithmetic, which spills no carry flag there. A `umaal` multiply ran more
  instructions in [#281], so rind keeps the verified code.

The table describes `main`, and changes alongside the code it describes. The
tests use [Wycheproof]'s vectors.

Their proof of its aarch64 routine for the SHA-512 instructions ends with the result in registers, before the routine stores it, so rind's own HOL Light proof covers that routine, of the object code rind's build emits, against s2n-bignum's FIPS 180-4 spec. `admin/prove bytes` checks that rind's copies of the first two routines assemble to the instructions of aws-lc's text at the revision the proofs pin, so the proofs are of rind's code.

## s2n-bignum's constant-time theorems

s2n-bignum's `_SAFE` theorems prove, for every input, that the instructions a
routine executes and the addresses it accesses depend on no secret, and that
it runs no instruction whose timing depends on its operands. `admin/prove
bytes`, in the `prove` workflow, checks that each routine's `asm!` block in
rind's release build holds the instructions its proof lists, upstream's
proof at the base commit of rind's fork, `thirdparty/s2n-bignum`, so those
theorems are about the code rind runs. A block
differs from its proof's code only as `admin/prove-bytes` lists, none of the
changes altering the result the proof states or making a branch, address, or
timing depend on a secret: the final `ret` is gone, as the Rust function
returns; an x86_64 routine using 256-bit registers ends with `vzeroupper`; an
aarch64 routine has no `BTI c`, as in the code the `_NOIBT_` theorems cover; a
routine returning from several places, or whose local subroutines follow its
`ret`, branches to the block's end from each such `ret`; and LLVM's assembler
writes some commutative x86_64 instructions with their sources swapped.

The table names, for each Rust function rind transliterates from s2n-bignum,
the routine it runs on each target and the subroutine `_SAFE` theorem that
covers it, or "none" where s2n-bignum proves none at the pinned revision.
LLVM may inline `bignum_modadd`, which a hot loop calls, so no symbol marks
its copies and the check does not reach them; the check fails if such a
routine has a `_SAFE` theorem.
`admin/ct-binsec` checks those in the loop, `PosInt::reduce_even`, with
BINSEC. The
aarch64 AES-GCM theorems assume separate input and output buffers, so they do
not cover rind's in-place calls.

## Implementation details

### RSA
On x86_64 and aarch64, the Montgomery products are mostly aws-lc's, and
s2n-bignum provides the rest of the arithmetic, under the exponentiation
described below. x86_64 runs aws-lc's Montgomery multiplication as aws-lc's
`bn_mul_mont` picks it (`bn_mul4x_mont` for moduli whose width in 64-bit words
is a multiple of four, `bn_sqr8x_mont` for squaring a multiple of eight, each
by `mulx` with ADX, and `bn_mul_mont_nohw` for other widths), other than
1024- and 2048-bit moduli on CPUs with ADX, where s2n-bignum's Karatsuba
routines are as fast or faster, and the RSAZ paths below. aarch64 runs
aws-lc's `bn_mul_mont`, which picks its own squaring or 4x routine by the
width, at every size: on a Neoverse-N2 it measured 1.15 to 2 times as fast as
s2n-bignum's generic routines, and faster than its Karatsuba routines for
1024- and 2048-bit moduli.
armv7 runs the same exponentiation over aws-lc's 32-bit ARM `bn_mul_mont`
routines as aws-lc picks them (`bn_mul8x_mont_neon` with NEON for moduli whose
width in 32-bit words is a multiple of eight, and `bn_mul_mont_nohw`
otherwise), and the rest of the arithmetic in rind's portable Rust. The
portable backend runs it all in that Rust, over 64-bit limbs on 64-bit
targets and 32-bit ones elsewhere: its Montgomery products below 16 limbs by
rind's loop (Koç, Acar, and Kaliski's CIOS method), and wider ones and its
squarings by forming the product, each square's cross products once, then
reducing it, adding two rows a pass in two carry chains. A single-row
`x += y * u` issues each block of four products before that block's carry
chain, and finishes a remainder of one to three limbs one limb at a time.
Products split by Karatsuba's method from 32 limbs and squares from 64, as
aws-lc's C does from 16 words. RSA signing and verification at 2048 to 8192
bits measured at 0.85 to 0.97× aws-lc's C time without assembly on x86_64.
On x86_64 CPUs with AVX2 but without ADX, the private operation's exponentiation modulo each 1024-bit
prime of RSA-2048 runs aws-lc's RSAZ, as aws-lc does there: Montgomery
products on AVX2 over 29-bit limbs, and a 5-bit fixed window whose table
entry is gathered by masking all 32 entries. Otherwise x86_64 runs aws-lc's
5-bit window, as `BN_mod_exp_mont_consttime` does, gathering each entry by
masking all 32 entries with AVX2, and otherwise by s2n-bignum's verified
routine, which reads every entry. For moduli of a
multiple of 512 bits other than 1024 and 2048 bits with ADX, it runs aws-lc's
`bn_power5` instead: five squarings and the product by an entry gathered by
masking all 32, in one call.
On x86_64 CPUs with AVX-512 IFMA, both exponentiations of the CRT for primes
of 1024, 1536, or 2048 bits run at once by aws-lc's dual RSAZ, as aws-lc's
`BN_mod_exp_mont_consttime_x2` does there: almost Montgomery products on
256-bit vectors over 52-bit limbs, two moduli at a time, and a 5-bit fixed
window whose table entries are gathered by masking all 32. Valgrind runs no
AVX-512, so `admin/ct-sde` checks it under Intel SDE instead.

The RSA private operation always uses the CRT optimisation.

On aarch64 and armv7, modular exponentiation uses a 5-bit fixed exponent window, as aws-lc's does,
and the term is selected by the exponent bits from the table of base powers in a side-channel-free way.

On every architecture, the private operation is always followed by the public operation to verify the result
(and the result compared in a side-channel-free way).

RSA signs and verifies with PKCS#1 v1.5 and PSS, and encrypts with OAEP on
SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.  Private keys have 2048- to 8192-bit
moduli; verification also takes 1024-bit moduli and SHA-1, but only under
`signature::verify::legacy`.  Every key refuses a public exponent that is
even, 1, or over 33 bits, and a private key whose components disagree is
refused when it loads, as aws-lc's `RSA_check_key` does.  Public keys load
from PKCS#1 `RSAPublicKey` or `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` DER, or from their
modulus and exponent.  Each OAEP key is bound to one hash.  OAEP decryption is
constant time through its padding check, and fails every malformed
ciphertext with the same error, so it is no Manger oracle.  PKCS#1 v1.5
encryption, which invites padding-oracle attacks, is refused.

RSA blind signatures (RFC 9474) take no arithmetic of their own: a client
blinds a message's RSASSA-PSS encoding by the public operation on a random
blind and a Montgomery multiplication, the server signs it by the private
operation above, checked against its public key, and the client unblinds the
reply by the blind's inverse, from `bignum_modinv`.  Rather than
RSASSA-PSS-VERIFY, which would branch on what a malicious reply unblinds to
(1 unblinds to the inverse itself), the client checks in constant time that
the result's public operation gives the very encoding it blinded.  Blinding
and unblinding run in constant time in the message, its prefix and salt, and
the blind, revealing only which candidate blinds rejection sampling discards
and whether the reply was good.

RSA key generation is supported for five fixed key sizes between 2048-8192-bits.
All generated keys have e = 0x10001 and, as in aws-lc, d reduced mod
lcm(p - 1, q - 1).  Generation runs in constant time in the primes, revealing
only which candidates it discards.

### ECC
On x86_64 and aarch64, all ECC field and scalar arithmetic are provided by
s2n-bignum, except P256's on x86_64 where aws-lc's is named below, and
Ed25519 verification's on x86_64 CPUs with AVX2 but without ADX, which runs
curve25519-dalek's AVX2 backend over width-5 and width-8 non-adjacent forms
of its two scalars, the latter over a 10 KiB table of the base point's odd
multiples. The rest of this section describes those backends.

Where s2n-bignum ships a routine in two verified variants, aarch64 runs the
scalar `_alt` one under the plain name: on Apple's M1 and M4 and on Neoverse
N2 it runs every curve routine rind uses in 50-98% of the time of the
other, which mixes in SIMD multiplies.

P256 base point multiplication on x86_64 runs aws-lc's algorithm: 7-bit Booth
windows over 37 rows of 64 affine points (a 152KB constant table), each row
scanned whole by rind's constant-time Rust select and added by aws-lc's mixed
addition, `ecp_nistz256_point_add_affine`, with `mulq` or with BMI2 and ADX,
in the order aws-lc's `ecp_nistz256_point_mul_base` runs them. On
aarch64 it is s2n-bignum's `p256_scalarmulbase`, over 6-bit Booth windows and
a table of each window's 32 multiples (an 88KB constant table). Variable
point multiplication is s2n-bignum's `p256_scalarmul` on both, whose proof
covers the conversion back to affine coordinates.

armv7 runs the aarch64 algorithms for P256 in portable Rust, over
fiat-crypto's field and scalar arithmetic, except its Montgomery
multiplication and squaring, which are rind's. LLVM compiles fiat-crypto's
32-bit multiplication to save and restore the one carry flag 171 times a
call, between its interleaved carry chains; rind's carry in 64-bit
accumulators (`umaal`) instead, in 560 instructions run to fiat-crypto's
1,375. fiat-crypto cannot generate an unsaturated P256, as it does P521:
its bounds checks fail at every 32-bit limb count from 9 to 16. armv7's
P384 runs rind's Montgomery multiplication and squaring the same way, in
1,151 instructions to fiat-crypto's 2,254, over fiat-crypto's other field
and scalar arithmetic. The portable backend runs the same on 32-bit
targets, and on 64-bit ones over fiat-crypto's 64-bit arithmetic whole, its
multiplication included.

P384 base point multiplication uses a comb of 20 tables of 16 affine points
(a 30KB constant table) over 5-bit Booth windows, as aws-lc does. Variable
point multiplication is s2n-bignum's `p384_montjscalarmul`.

P521's prime is a Mersenne prime, so its field arithmetic is direct rather
than Montgomery's. Base point multiplication uses a comb of 27 tables of 16
affine points (a 62KB constant table) over 5-bit Booth windows, as aws-lc
does. Variable point multiplication is s2n-bignum's `p521_jscalarmul`.
s2n-bignum's P521 point addition requires points that are not at infinity,
equal, or opposite, so the comb keeps to that, selecting around the cases
it reaches.

ECDSA verification computes `u1 G + u2 Q` in one chain of doublings, as
aws-lc does, adding terms from width-5 non-adjacent forms of the public
scalars: `u2`'s over the public key's odd multiples, computed when the key is
parsed and made affine by one batched inversion, and `u1`'s over the first
row of the base point table, at width 6 for P256, as its aarch64 row holds 32
multiples, so every addition is a mixed one. A key's second verification
also builds 17Q to 31Q, so that `u2`'s digits widen to 6 from then on: a key
verified once never pays for them. s2n-bignum's point
additions are proven only for unequal points, so each addition first
compares x's and settles equal or opposite points by cases. The portable
backend's P521 runs the whole chain in fiat-crypto's limbs, rather than
converting each coordinate to and from words at every point routine, and
reads the x's difference from the addition's own first steps. Each curve
then checks `r` against `X / Z²` as `r Z² = X`, and `(r + n) Z² = X` when
`r + n < p`, without an inversion.
Those checks cost a key parsed and verified once, as TLS does with each
certificate key, about 5-6% against verifying without them (aarch64 and
x86_64 P-256 runs 41907443804 and 41907448202); keys verified more than once
are faster than before.

ECDSA follows RFC6979 for generation of `k`, but adds additional non-critical random input.
We do this to avoid the theoretical fragility of RFC6979 under fault conditions.
This is allowed for by RFC6979, and the HMAC-DRBG that it builds on.
The code is structured such that we pass the RFC6979 test vectors.

The code which selects a term from a table of points is non-verified,
and is written in AVX2, SSE2, or Neon intrinsics, or for P256 on x86_64 is
aws-lc's SSE2 and AVX2 assembly, or on armv7 is portable Rust. aarch64's P256
base point multiplication is the exception: its selection is inside
s2n-bignum's verified `p256_scalarmulbase`.

On x86_64 and aarch64, X25519 directly uses the s2n-bignum implementation.

ECVRF (RFC 9381) is rind's, over the curves' code above: on edwards25519, the
ristretto255 code's constant-time variable-point multiplication and
s2n-bignum's base point multiplication and decoding, or curve25519-dalek's on
armv7 and portable; on P256, the ECDH and ECDSA multiplications, and RFC6979
over the HMAC-DRBG for the nonce, with no added randomness, as the suite's
test vectors require. Proving runs in constant time in the key and the nonce.
Verification multiplies by the proof's scalars in constant time too on
edwards25519, where it is public data, as no variable-time multiplication of
an arbitrary point is there to reuse; P256's computes `s G - c Y` as ECDSA
verification does. Try-and-increment's loop runs in time that depends on the
input, as RFC 9381 notes.

The OPRFs (RFC 9497) are rind's too, over the same code: ristretto255's
constant-time multiplications and RFC 9496 map, or curve25519-dalek's on
armv7 and portable, and the NIST curves' ECDH multiplications and RFC 9380
hash-to-curve, with `expand_message_xmd` over the suite's SHA-2 for each
hash to a scalar. Blinding, evaluation, proving, and finalization run in
constant time in the input, the blind, the key, and the proof's nonce.
Verifying a DLEQ proof handles public data only: ristretto255's still
multiplies in constant time, as with ECVRF on edwards25519, and the NIST
curves' compute `s G + c Y` as ECDSA verification does, and their other
sums from constant-time products. The suites' vectors and the `voprf` crate
cover the composition; nothing in it is proven.

### ML-KEM-768
On aarch64, and on x86_64 CPUs with AVX2, the core polynomial arithmetic -- the NTT, inverse NTT, base multiplication
and reduction -- is provided by s2n-bignum (contributed by the mlkem-native
developers).  The surrounding FIPS-203 construction (key generation,
encapsulation and decapsulation) is written in Rust. With AVX2, ciphertext
compression runs mlkem-native's AVX2 assembly.

x86_64 CPUs without AVX2 run the same construction over a Rust port of
mlkem-native's portable C arithmetic instead, in natural coefficient order as
aarch64 keeps it, and Keccak-f four states one at a time, chosen once per
process. It measured 1.3x faster than libcrux's portable ML-KEM for key
generation and encapsulation there, and 2x for decapsulation.

armv7 runs the same construction and arithmetic, with [OpenSSL]'s Keccak-f:
NEON where the CPU has it, and integer code on bit-interleaved lanes
otherwise. Keccak-f dominates ML-KEM there, and compiled code spills its
state. With NEON it measured 1.5x faster than libcrux's portable ML-KEM for
key generation and encapsulation, and 2.8x for decapsulation. Without NEON,
under qemu, it ran key generation and encapsulation in 1.3x fewer
instructions. The portable backend runs it with rind's Keccak-f, proven in
[`proofs/`](proofs/README.md).

Compression and decompression are division-free, avoiding the variable-time
division behind the KyberSlash attacks.

For sampling, which is a significant factor in ML-KEM performance, we
have some different options depending on CPU features:

- We have a `SampleNTT()` which does 8-wide Keccak-f permutation followed by
  rejection sampling using AVX-512 (F, BW, VBMI, VBMI2) on x86-64. This is
  Graviola's, and not verified.
- We have s2n-bignum's verified 4-wide Keccak-f using AVX2 on x86-64, and its
  single-state Keccak-f otherwise.
- We have s2n-bignum's verified 2-wide Keccak-f using Neon+SHA3 on aarch64.
- We have s2n-bignum's verified single-state Keccak-f on aarch64, using the
  SHA3 instructions where the CPU has them.
- We have OpenSSL's Keccak-f, on NEON or bit-interleaved in integer code, on
  armv7.
- We have rind's Keccak-f, proven in [`proofs/`](proofs/README.md), one state
  at a time, on the portable backend.

### ML-DSA
ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, and ML-DSA-87 share one FIPS 204 construction (key
generation, signing, verification, and the key and signature encodings): a
Rust port of [mldsa-native]'s C. On aarch64, and on x86_64 CPUs with AVX2,
its polynomial arithmetic and rejection sampling run s2n-bignum's verified
routines, contributed by the mldsa-native developers: the NTT and its
inverse, pointwise multiplication, reduction, decomposition, hints, norm
checks, and unpacking.

x86_64 CPUs without AVX2, armv7, and the portable backend run a Rust port of
mldsa-native's portable C arithmetic instead. Its NTT walks each layer
through split slices, which leave its butterflies without bounds checks;
indexing as the C does left portable signing 1.07-1.12x slower than
aws-lc-rs. Keccak-f, which expands the matrix and samples the secrets, the
mask, and the challenge, runs as ML-KEM's does (see
[ML-KEM-768](#ml-kem-768)), four states at a time where the CPU allows.

Signing declassifies which attempt it accepts, and why it rejects the
others, as mldsa-native does: FIPS 204's security argument makes them
public.

On an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X shared with other jobs, so noisy, rind took
0.64-0.75x aws-lc-rs's time with AVX2, 0.82-0.91x without it, and
0.83-0.92x on the portable backend, for key generation, signing, and
verification at each parameter set. libcrux's, RustCrypto's, and
OpenSSL's ML-DSA were slower than aws-lc-rs's with AVX2, and libcrux's
portable ML-DSA was no faster than aws-lc-rs without assembly.

### Symmetric cryptography
SHA1 and SHA256 have straightforward implementations using hashing intrinsics
(aka "SHA-NI" on x86_64, "sha" extension on aarch64), except that aarch64 runs
aws-lc's SHA256 assembly for those instructions: it keeps a register copy off
each round's dependency chain, where LLVM's code for the intrinsics puts one
on it, and x86_64 runs LLVM's code for its SHA256 intrinsics frozen into
inline assembly, so that a proof can be about the bytes it runs, with the
last block's padding in Rust. Without SHA-NI, x86_64
selects at runtime an AVX2 message schedule with scalar rounds for SHA1, as
aws-lc does, and for SHA256 runs OpenSSL's AVX2 routine, which aws-lc leaves
out: 1.12x faster than aws-lc's AVX routine on an i7-8700 and 1.13x on Arrow
Lake, and 1.17x faster than the Rust AVX2 port it replaces on the i7-8700.
Without AVX2, both run aws-lc's AVX routines on Intel and its SSSE3 ones
elsewhere, as aws-lc picks; they are
2.2x (SHA256) and 1.7x (SHA1) faster than the pure Rust ones on Intel.
Without SSSE3 too, both run aws-lc's integer routines, as aws-lc does: 2.2x
(SHA256) and 1.25x (SHA1) faster than the pure Rust ones, and 1.3-1.5x
faster than HACL*'s SHA256.
aarch64 without the crypto extension runs aws-lc's
scalar SHA1 and SHA256 assembly. 32-bit `arm` runs aws-lc's SHA1 and SHA256 assembly
where the CPU has the crypto extension, and the pure Rust SHA1 and SHA256
otherwise: libcrux has no SHA1, and the pure Rust SHA256 is faster than
libcrux's.

SHA384, SHA512, and SHA512/256 run aws-lc's assembly everywhere but on
x86_64 CPUs with AVX2, which run OpenSSL's: its routine for the SHA512
instructions where the CPU has them, 5.4x faster than aws-lc's AVX routine on
Arrow Lake, and its AVX2 routine otherwise, which aws-lc leaves out: 1.18x
faster than aws-lc's AVX routine on an i7-8700 and 1.15x on Arrow Lake, and
1.47x faster than its scalar one on AMD's Zen 3. Without AVX2, aws-lc's AVX
routine runs on Intel and its scalar routine on other CPUs, as aws-lc picks:
the AVX routine is 1.1x faster than the scalar one on Intel, and 1.5x slower
on AMD's Zen. On aarch64, its routine for the SHA-512 instructions where the CPU
has them, and its scalar routine otherwise; on 32-bit `arm`, its NEON routine
where the CPU has NEON, and its scalar routine otherwise.

SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512 run Graviola's sponge over the Keccak-f
ML-KEM uses (see [ML-KEM-768](#ml-kem-768)), one state at a time.
[`proofs/`](proofs/README.md) proves the sponge, and ML-KEM's SHAKE calls,
against FIPS 202 down to s2n-bignum's Keccak-f routines on x86_64 and
aarch64, and the portable backend's Keccak-f against the spec those routines'
proofs state.

x86_64 decides once per process whether the CPU has AES-NI and PCLMULQDQ,
and SSSE3. Without the first two, as on Core 2 and Nehalem, AES and AES-CTR
run aws-lc's `vpaes-x86_64` assembly and GHASH its `ghash-ssse3-x86_64`,
composed into AES-GCM as aws-lc composes them, taking turns over 3 KB; both
modes measured level with aws-lc's. Without SSSE3 either, as on QEMU's
`qemu64`, they run Rust ports of the C aws-lc runs there: `aes_nohw.c`, which
bitslices eight blocks into SSE2 registers and computes the S-box as a
circuit, and `gcm_nohw.c`, which multiplies with integer multiplies of
operands masked to every fourth bit, so no carry reaches a bit it keeps.
Neither branches or indexes memory by a secret. Composed the same way,
AES-GCM and AES-CTR measured 0.82-0.92x aws-lc's time; libcrux's portable
AES-GCM measured 3-7x slower. With AES-NI and PCLMULQDQ, AES-CTR runs aws-lc's
`aes_hw_ctr32_encrypt_blocks`, 1.1-2x faster than rind's by-8 intrinsics at
every length, with or without AVX.

AES-GCM has a stitched by-8 AES-CTR and a by-8 GHASH, SSE-encoded on every
CPU: VEX encoding measured no faster with AVX, and without it, as on Westmere
and the Goldmont and Tremont Atoms, this is 1.02-1.28x faster than aws-lc's
SSE `aesni-x86_64` and `ghash-x86_64` routines. With AVX and MOVBE but no
VAES, as from Haswell through Comet Lake and on Zen 1 and 2, [HACL\*]'s
Vale AES-GCM runs the AEAD: its counter block, and a port of OpenSSL's
`aesni_gcm`, which interleaves AES-CTR and GHASH six blocks at a time from
288 bytes to encrypt and 96 to decrypt, then takes the rest a block at a time
and checks the tag. Seals under 129 bytes run the by-8 path instead, as Vale's
measured 0.94-1.19x its time there on Coffee Lake (medians 1.04-1.06x). rind computes the round keys and GHASH key powers itself,
in the layout Vale's proof assumes, since Vale's own setup measured twice as
slow, and `proofs/` proves them and the Rust around Vale's routines end to
end. Vale's proof stops at 2^32 bytes of message or AAD, so longer ones run
the by-8 code, as do those short seals, IVs other than 96 bits, and the
opening of truncated tags, whose tag check Vale's routine does not take.
`proofs/` proves the by-8 code against Vale's AES-GCM spec without that
bound, for 96-bit IVs and full tags, with AES-128 and AES-256. Every 256- and 512-bit kernel rind runs ends with
`vzeroupper`, so SSE code after one pays no AVX-SSE transition or false
dependency. There is also an optional AVX-512 by-16 AES-CTR
and GHASH.  It uses dynamic CPU feature detection, so AVX-512 is not required at runtime.
On cores with VAES, BoringSSL's kernels, which interleave AES-CTR and GHASH, take
long messages: its 512-bit kernel from 2 KB where the CPU has AVX-512 (the by-16
path is quicker below that), and its 256-bit kernel from 256 bytes otherwise.
Below 256 bytes, Vale's AES-GCM opens on VAES cores without AVX-512, where it
measured 0.83-1.09x the by-8 path's time on Zen 3 (median 0.95x), and
0.74-1.06x on Arrow Lake's P-cores and 0.70-1.08x on its E-cores (medians
0.88x and 0.90x), under an AAD of a partial block, as QUIC's and TLS's are,
or of whole ones. Short seals there run the by-8 path, which Vale trailed on
both from 16 bytes up to 176. AVX-512 cores run the by-8 path for every short
message: Vale's opens measured 0.95-1.44x its time on Zen 5 (median 1.03x),
0.96-1.37x on Granite Rapids (median 1.07x), and 0.70-1.14x on Zen 4 (median
1.00x), and its seals lost on all three.
Vale's proof covers those short opens' kernel, but not the choice of it,
which [`proofs/`](proofs/README.md) proves only without VAES.
The key picks its kernel once, when it is made.

aarch64 decides once per process whether the CPU has the crypto extension.
With it, AES-GCM runs s2n-bignum's kernels, which interleave AES-CTR and GHASH
over whole blocks: by 8 on a core with SHA3, using its three-way XOR, as aws-lc
does on Apple and Neoverse V cores, and by 4 otherwise. They run in place,
outside their proofs, which assume separate input and output buffers.
`admin/parse-asm/inplace.py` walks them at every length to 64 blocks, checking
that each block is loaded before it is stored and that their branches and
addresses depend only on the length. Up to 15 blocks of AAD and message
sealed, or 31 opened, rind's own Rust runs instead: one pass that encrypts
every counter block and the tag's, and hashes every block with one reduction
per eight. It measured 0.41-0.97x the kernels' time on Neoverse N2 and
0.51-0.89x on Apple M1, gaining least near those limits. Its tests check it
against vpaes and NEON GHASH.

Without it, AES runs aws-lc's `vpaes-armv8`, Mike Hamburg's vector permutation
AES, whose S-box is NEON `tbl` lookups into registers, and GHASH runs aws-lc's
`ghash-neon-armv8`, which builds each product from NEON's 8-bit polynomial
multiplies; neither reads memory or branches by a secret. AES-GCM runs AES-CTR
and GHASH over each eight blocks in turn, as aws-lc composes them.

32-bit `arm` decides once per process from `AT_HWCAP2`: with the crypto
extension, AES and AES-GCM keys use aws-lc's `aesv8-armx` and `ghashv8-armx`
assembly, composed as aws-lc does on that architecture; without it, the
same `aes_nohw.c` port x86_64 runs without SSSE3, in its 32-bit
configuration, which bitslices two blocks into 32-bit words, and for AES-GCM a
port of aws-lc's `gcm_nohw.c` in its 32-bit configuration, composed the same
way. A key expands both once, when it is made, holding its round keys
bitsliced, and seals and opens in place. The portable backend always takes the
paths without the extension, and runs both ports in their 64-bit
configurations on 64-bit targets, four blocks into 64-bit words. On x86_64
under `--cfg rind_portable` they measured 0.18x the time of the libcrux
bitsliced block cipher they replaced for AES-GCM from 1200 bytes, and
0.93-1.03x aws-lc's time there, whose C bitslices eight blocks into SSE2
registers on that row; AES-CTR and CBC decryption measured 1.08-1.23x it.

AES-192 takes each of these paths with 12 rounds, but for three sources with
no AES-192: Vale's AES-GCM, so x86_64 runs the by-8 code where Vale would
run; s2n-bignum's aarch64 AES-GCM kernels, so aarch64 runs aws-lc's by-8
`aesv8_gcm_8x_enc_192` and `aesv8_gcm_8x_dec_192` past `short`'s lengths on a
core with SHA3, which aws-lc runs on Apple and Neoverse V cores, and AES-CTR
and GHASH in turn without it.
aws-lc's routines are not verified. Valgrind hides SHA3 from
`admin/ctgrind`, so `admin/ct-qemu` checks them, and the eight-way kernels,
under qemu-aarch64.
AES-NI and ARMv8 expand an AES-192 key six words per vector step, with the
SubWord the other sizes take, measured 0.88-0.94x aws-lc-rs's AES-GCM key
setup on Zen 3 and Neoverse N2; the bitsliced path runs aws-lc's schedule,
which keeps a window of a block and a half. Against aws-lc-rs, AES-192-GCM measured 0.43-0.57x on
Zen 3 with VAES and 0.44-1.03x without AVX2, as AES-128 did, 0.43-0.47x on
N2 at 32 bytes and 0.74-0.84x from 1200 bytes, where aws-lc runs its by-4
routine, and 0.90-1.02x on Apple M1 and 0.92-0.99x on M4 from 1200 bytes
with `rind::cpu::Dit::hold()` held, 1.01-1.21x without it.
AES-192-CTR and CBC measured as AES-128 did on each.

x86_64 CPUs with AVX2 run ChaCha20 on Graviola's AVX2 kernels from two
blocks, and on HACL*'s verified rounds in general-purpose registers for one
block, as QUIC header protection takes and as aws-lc runs its integer routine
there: the kernels compute even one block as a single serial chain, which Zen
5's two-cycle vector latency doubles, so header protection on them took 1.89
of aws-lc-rs's time on an EPYC 9V45 in [run 41585945720]. On HACL*'s rounds
it takes 0.89 on an EPYC 9V74 (Zen 4) in [run 41678532920], against 0.83 on
the kernels in [run 41657617706]. No run has drawn Zen 5 since; the fix is
expected to hold there because HChaCha20, below, measured the same cause and
fix on it. For one block, the kernels measured 1.05-1.3x faster than HACL*'s
rounds on Coffee Lake, Arrow Lake, and Zen 3, where HACL*'s rounds are within
10% of aws-lc's integer routine.

x86_64 CPUs without AVX2 run ChaCha20 above 128 bytes on aws-lc's
`chacha-x86_64` SSSE3 routine, four blocks at a time, as aws-lc picks it,
which measured 2.4-2.7x faster than HACL*'s rounds from 256 bytes on Coffee
Lake, Zen 3, and Arrow Lake. Up to that, and at every length without SSSE3,
where aws-lc runs its integer routine, they run HACL*'s verified rounds, which
took 0.92-1.07 of that routine's time on the same CPUs. Header protection without AVX2 takes 0.91 of
aws-lc-rs's time on an EPYC 9V74 and 0.96 on a Xeon Platinum 8573C in
[run 41697909102].

QUIC header protection runs HACL*'s verified rounds in general-purpose
registers on every architecture, one block straight from the key and sample,
and `proofs/` proves it end to end against RFC 9001 and RFC 8439, the rounds
included. On a Neoverse-N2 it took 0.87 of the time of the code it replaced,
Graviola's NEON block, on aarch64, and 0.79 of aws-lc's `chacha-armv4` on
armv7, in [run 41861521276] against [run 41861526675].

HChaCha20, for XChaCha20, runs HACL*'s verified rounds in general-purpose
registers on every architecture, as aws-lc does: one block in vector
registers is a single serial chain, which Zen 5's two-cycle vector latency
doubles. On an EPYC 9V45, sealing 32 B with XChaCha20-Poly1305 natively takes
0.99 of aws-lc-rs's time in [run 41585945720], against 1.11 with SSSE3 rounds
in [run 41550703300].

ChaCha20-Poly1305, and XChaCha20-Poly1305 after HChaCha20, run aws-lc's
`chacha20_poly1305` assembly, which interleaves ChaCha20 with Poly1305 in one
pass: on x86_64, its AVX2 half where the CPU has AVX2 and BMI2 and its SSE4.1
half otherwise, as aws-lc picks them, and on aarch64, its NEON routine.
aws-lc's x86_64 routine reads its pick from `OPENSSL_ia32cap_P`; rind's copy
reads the same bits from the block rind passes it, so the path is decided
once per process like rind's others. Without SSE4.1, ChaCha20 and Poly1305
run in separate passes, as in aws-lc.

Elsewhere, 32-bit `arm` runs ChaCha20 on aws-lc's `chacha-armv4` assembly,
switching from its integer routine to its NEON one at 192 bytes as aws-lc
does, where `AT_HWCAP` reports NEON. Poly1305 runs aws-lc's NEON code there too, and
HACL*'s verified Poly1305 without NEON.
