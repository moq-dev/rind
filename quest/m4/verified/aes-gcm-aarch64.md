# [L] AES-GCM on aarch64 is proven

## Goal

AES-GCM earns the ✓ on aarch64 with the crypto extension (Graviton, Apple, Ampere, and the other Neoverse cores): rind's key setup, its short-message pass, and its glue around s2n-bignum's proven kernels are proven from the AEAD API down.

## Plan

- Runs (`low/aarch64/aes_gcm.rs`, `aes.rs`, `ghash.rs`): rind's NEON key expansion, PMULL GHASH key table, J0 and counter, AAD GHASH, partial blocks, length block, and tag; s2n-bignum's kernels for whole blocks; and up to 15 blocks sealed or 31 opened, rind's own one-pass Rust, which encrypts every counter block and the tag's and hashes with one reduction per eight blocks.
- Already proven: the kernels, against SP 800-38D, in place or out, by s2n-bignum's theorems at rind's pin (`3f01260f`), which `admin/prove bytes` checks are of rind's code. Nothing of rind's Rust.
- Route: Aeneas to Lean, as `Rind/X86_64/AesGcm.lean` proves Vale's tier, with the kernels' theorems as axioms under the composition rule, and NEON intrinsics (`aese`, `aesmc`, `pmull`, `pmull2`, `eor3`, `ext`) modelled from the Arm manual as `Simd.lean` models Intel's. Reuse `Gf128.lean`'s Karatsuba lemmas, and `Rind/Aarch64/Neon.lean`'s AES models and `Rind/Aarch64/AesKey.lean`'s key expansion proofs.
- AES-192, which s2n-bignum's kernels lack, takes one of two paths past the short pass's lengths (`low/aarch64/aes_gcm.rs:262-267`, `:310-316`). Without the SHA3 instructions it runs AES-CTR and GHASH in turn; prove that composition here too. With them it runs aws-lc's `aesv8_gcm_8x_enc_192` and `aesv8_gcm_8x_dec_192` since [kixel-ai/rind#460](https://github.com/kixel-ai/rind/pull/460), which nothing proves: [their own quest](/quest/m4/verified/aes-gcm-aarch64-192.md) does, so AES-192-GCM earns the ✓ on those cores only once it lands, and this quest's ✓ for AES-192 names the cores without SHA3.
