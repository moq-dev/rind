# [S] Releases, docs.rs, and a comparison an adopter can read

## Goal

Each crate release has a GitHub Release carrying its changelog, docs.rs renders `rind` with every public item documented for the targets that matter, and the README has one table comparing rind with ring, aws-lc-rs, and RustCrypto, generated from the files that already hold the facts.

## Plan

Decided 2026-11-12 (maintainer, /quest-audit): ✅ all three, as one quest since each is small.

GitHub Releases:

- `.release-plz.toml:3` sets `git_release_enable = false`, so the only GitHub Release that day was rind-dart's. Find why before changing it: `git log -S git_release_enable -- .release-plz.toml` and the PR that set it. If the reason still holds, write it beside the setting and stop this part there with what you found.
- If it does not, enable releases for the published crates, with release-plz's changelog as the body. Tags and releases are created by the release job, which already runs only when a release PR merges.

docs.rs:

- No crate sets `[package.metadata.docs.rs]`, so docs.rs builds `rind` with its own defaults. Set the targets rind has backends for (x86_64 and aarch64 Linux, and one that takes the portable backend) and the features a reader needs to see.
- Check the build the way docs.rs runs it, with `cargo +nightly rustdoc` and `--cfg docsrs`, and fix what it warns about.
- The adapters get the same where they have features.

The comparison:

- One table in the README: pure Rust or not, build tools needed, targets, which algorithms, what is formally verified, and speed in one line with a link, for rind, ring, aws-lc-rs, and RustCrypto.
- Every cell comes from a file that already states it and is checked: ALGORITHMS.md, PLATFORMS.md, BENCHMARKS.md's build-cost section, and `benchmarks/verified.toml`. Generate it or test it the way the README's heatmap is kept current, so it cannot drift. A cell with no source is left out, not written from memory.
- It states the other libraries' strengths as plainly as rind's, each with a link to that project's own page: the FIPS 140-3 validation behind aws-lc-rs's `fips` feature, which rind lacks, and the audits ring and RustCrypto's crates have had.
- The validation belongs to particular AWS-LC-FIPS module versions, which that feature builds against, not to every aws-lc-rs build. Name the feature and take the module and its status from aws-lc-rs's own page.
- The README's "Before you depend on it" section, which the landing page quotes, names one strength of each library by hand. Once the table states them from its sources, replace those bullets with a link to it, so the site links it too.
- The README's first line stays as the maintainer wrote it.
