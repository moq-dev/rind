//! The FIPS module's random generator: SP 800-90A HMAC_DRBG with SHA-512,
//! at its 256-bit security strength, one instance per thread.
//!
//! Entropy comes from the OS, outside the module's boundary (IG 9.3.A
//! scenario 2(b)). Every request reseeds first, which is SP 800-90A's
//! prediction resistance: a forked child, which inherits its parent's
//! instance, still never repeats its parent's output. The OS read this costs
//! is the one a `rind` draw already makes.
//!
//! It lives at the crate root, not in `mid` beside [`crate::mid::rng`], which
//! draws from it in the module's build, because HMAC lives in `high`.
//!
//! Each thread's instance wipes itself as its thread exits. A process's
//! `exit` runs only the exiting thread's destructors, so the module's own
//! destructor wipes the rest with [`zeroise_all`], as aws-lc's
//! `rand_thread_state_clear_all` does.
