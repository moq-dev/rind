# The rind backends a diff can break: x86_64, aarch64, arm (armv7), and
# portable. The slow suites (armv7, qemu, Miri, ctgrind) run in full for a
# backend the diff reaches and skip one it does not, and `just check`'s cross,
# msrv, and vartime modules check only the reached backends' builds.
#
# Usage: sh/backends.sh CHANGED_FILE
#
# CHANGED_FILE lists the changed paths, one per line, as sh/changed.sh prints
# them; `-` reads them from stdin. Prints the reached backends one per line,
# sorted, `all` when the diff can reach every one, or `none`.
